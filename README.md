## Introduction

Parking in urban areas can be challenging. With the rise of smart cities, efficient parking management has become crucial. This project aims to simplify the parking experience by utilizing computer vision. By analyzing video feeds or images, we can identify open parking spaces and help drivers find them quickly.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Analyze video streams to detect available parking spots.
- **Image Processing**: Process images to identify occupancy.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize parking lot occupancy trends over time.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: For cloud-based coding and collaboration.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmet904-beep/computer-vision-parking-lot.git
   cd computer-vision-parking-lot
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Pre-trained Model**:
   You can find the pre-trained model in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Ahmet904-beep/computer-vision-parking-lot/releases). Download the latest version and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

To use the parking lot analysis tool, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <video_or_image_path>
```

Replace `<video_or_image_path>` with the path to your video or image file. The program will process the input and display the detected parking spaces.

### Example

```bash
python main.py --input parking_lot_video.mp4
```
