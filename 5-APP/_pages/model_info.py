'''Parking Spot Detection App - Model Information Page
This page provides information about the model used for parking spot detection. 
It includes details about the model architecture, dataset, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics.
The model is based on MobileNetV2 and is trained to classify parking spots as occupied or empty.

    1. A video is upload with a pre-defined binary mask.
    2. The binary mask identifies parking spot areas.
    3. Each spot is cropped and passed through the model.
    4. The model classifies it as **Occupied** or **Empty**.
    5. Bounding boxes are drawn on the image accordingly.
